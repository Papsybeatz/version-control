Git is a distributed version control system that help developers track changes in source code during software development.
GitHub is a web-based platform that allows developers to store, share, and collaborate on code.
 GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service which hosts repositories for collaboration while Git sits on your computer, to do its tracking.
 Github forsters collaboration betwen developers. Git allows dvelopers to create local repositories ensuring their work is backed up. 
One of the Git best practices are a. branching strategy b. Use pull requests for collaboration c. Tag releases. d. Document your workflow. e. rebase instead of merge when appropriate.
WD: referes to the directory on your local machine that contains the files and folders of your project.
Local repo - lives on our machine, where we make our changes and do our development. We cd (change directory)into a project directory and edit our code files. Remote repo - lives on GitHub, where anyone can view our files and clone or fork their own local copy.
Staging is the process of preparing changes to be commited to a repository.
Git init is a command that initializes a new, empty repository in the specified directory. 
Git clone is a command used to create a copy of an existing Git repository while Git pull is a command used to update your local repository with changes from a remote repository.
Git confit is a command used to customize and configure various aspects of your git environment, allowing you to set personal preferences like your username and more on a local or global project level.
A "Git branching strategy" refers to a set of rules that a development team follows when creating, merging, and managing different branches within a Git repository, allowing multiple developers to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other's code.
In Git, branching allows developers to create separate working areas where they can experiment with new features, fix bugs, or make changes without affecting the main codebase, enabling parallel work and ensuring a clean separation between different development streams within a project. 
A commit message explains what change you made to your project.
The advantages of distributed version control are: eliminating a single point of failure by allowing developers to work independently with a local copy of the codebase, enabling faster operations due to local commits and merges, flexible branching strategies, and the ability to work offline effectively; essentially providing greater autonomy and resilience compared to centralized version control systems.
